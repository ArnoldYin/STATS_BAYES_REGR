<h1>Bayesian Regression</h1>
<p>The procedure calculates the Bayes factors and the posterior probabilities for
a set of models using various combinations of the independent variables as
specified in the Models box.  The posterior distributions for a single selected
model can also be displayed.  The models are numbered for reference in the Model Comparisons
and Posterior Distribution fields, so it is useful to first run this procedure without using these
numbers in order to see how the models are numbered.
</p>
<p>The Bayes factor is the relative evidence in the data for one model over another.  See the reference below for an introductory discussion.</p>

<p>Split files and the Statistics case weights are not supported by this procedure.
Cases with missing values will be omitted from the analysis.</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Dependent</span> Specify the dependent variable.</p>
<p><span class="runinhead">Independent</span> Specify the independent variables.
Only continuous variables can be used.  You can dichotomize categorical variables
and use them here as long as the measurement levels are set to scale.</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Models</span> This setting determines which
models will be estimated from the set of independent variables. 
<p><li><strong>All</strong> produces results for all combinations of the variables.</li>
<li><strong>Single Deletion</strong> produces all the models where exactly one independent variable
is omitted.</li>
<li><strong>Single Variable</strong> produces all the models that include a single
independent variable.</li>
<li><strong>Single Model with All Variables</strong> produces a single model containing all the
independent variables.  In this case, the Model Comparisons, Posterior Model Number, and
Plot models Bayes Factors 
settings on the Options subdialog do not apply, and the posterior distribution is always produced.
</ul></p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<p><span class="runinhead">Model Comparisons</span> 
By default, the Bayes factors are computed relative to an intercept-only
model.  You can change the basis by specifying a model number.  You can
see how the models are numbered  by running the specification once without
using this option.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Posterior Distribution</span>
You can display the posterior distribution of the model coefficients
for a single model by specifying the model number.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Number of samples</span> Specify the
number of iterations (samples) to be drawn in calculating the
posterior distribution.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Plot model Bayes factors</span>
Check this box to display a graph of the Bayes factors.  If the number
of models is more than about ten, however, the chart will be very
difficult to read.
</p>
<p><span class="runinhead">Maximum Number of Models</span>
Specify a limit on the number of models to be estimated.
</p>
<p><span class="runinhead">Prior Scale</span>
Choose the scale for the prior on all the standardized slopes.

The scale parameter controls the expected true standardized effect size.
For a particular scale 50% of the true effect sizes are within the interval. For "medium", this is (-.7071, .7071). Wide is (-1, 1), and ultrawide is (-1.414, 1.414).
</p>

<h2>Additional Features</h2>
<p>
This dialog generates syntax for the STATS BAYES REGR extension command. To display syntax help for this command,
run the following syntax:
</p>
<p class="codeblock">STATS BAYES REGR /HELP.</p>
<p>In Statistics version 23 or later, you can place the cursor within the command in the Syntax Editor and press F1.</p>
<p>Using syntax you can save the R workspace to a file or keep it in memory for use by
an R program run within Statistics.</p>
